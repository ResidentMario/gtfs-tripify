gtfs_tripify
============

Most major transit municipalities in the United States publish realtime train (and bus) arrival information using a specification known as `GTFS-RT <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/>`_. ``gtfs_tripify`` is a Python package for turning an archived stream of GTFS-RT messages into a historical record of train (or bus) arrival and departure timesâ€”information that was previously only available in schedule form.
