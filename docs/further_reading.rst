Technical references:

* To learn some of the gory details of how ``gtfs_tripify`` is implemented, I recommend reading `my explanatory blog post`_ on the subject.

Inspiration:

* Philippe Vibien's `NYC Subway Stringlines`_ projects also uses GTFS-RT data.
* As does Todd Schneider's static `NYC Subway Analysis`_.
